      <h3>More Infomation:</h3>
      <p>
        This site is a visualization of bacteria data collected from belly button samples provided by volunteers.
        You may choose which sample to view by selecting from the drop-down menu. 
        In the panel below, some demographic info of the selected volunteer will be displayed. This comes from the meta data from the volunteer such as their gender, ethnicity, and age.
        There is also a graph made using Plotly sourced from a JSON file with all the samples. The graph will display the top 10 cultures found in the specific subject's samples.
        Then a gauge graph displaying the subjectâ€™s weekly frequency of belly button washes. Displaying a gauge which fills up dynamically as you cycle through each subject.
        Finally, there is a bubble chart that shows the different cultures per sample. The size of each bubble scales to the number of cultures. The color of each bubble is based on the ID number of the OTU.
        Hovering near or over a bubble will display the OTU ID, No. of Cultures, and the labels associated within.

          Hovering over each bar will display the number of specimens found of a specific type, as well as the labels of each type.

        <p>This chart above shows the number of each bacteria sample, the size of each bubble is proportional to the population of the specific 
          culture hovering over a bubble will show the ID, count, and labels of the specific culture. (Labels plainly as 'bacteria' are incomplete)
          This chart will dynamically update with the subject you select.
